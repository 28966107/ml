# Machine Learning Code

This Repository is python code which packages some  commonly used methods about machine learning method.

I will make subsequent updates to the code.

Specific usage details can be obtained from the source code.

Here is some brief information about code

linear_model:
- LinearRegression-Ridge-Lasso-Collinearity-Optimizer(includeing gradient descent and adamoptimizier)-R²-modified R²，and so on
      
DecisionTree:
- ID3-C4.5-Cart(Regression),but i did not package it into a class.

NaiveBayes:
- MultinomialNB:Multinomial Naive Bayes
