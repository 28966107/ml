# Machine Learning Code
-------------------------

This Repository is some code which packages commonly used methods about machine learning method.

I will make subsequent updates to the code.

Specific usage details can be obtained from the source code.

Here is some brief information about code

linear_model - : LinearRegression、Ridge、Lasso、AdamOptimizer、iterate_ridge and so on.

- DecisionTree: ID3,C4.5,Cart(Regression).
  
- NaiveBayes: MultinomialNB,GaussianNB.

- Gan: Generate handwritten digital pictures through Gan and achieve by tensorflow.

- ann_by_matlab:  a simple artificial neural networks achieved by matlab to distinguish the mnist digital dataset.

- CNN: Recognize digital verification code through CNN

- SVM: SMO Algorithm.

- KMeans++ : cluster.
